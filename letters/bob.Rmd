**RE: INVITATION LETTER FOR MR. JOHN KING'ATHIA KARUITHIA**

I am writing this letter regarding Mr John Kingâ€™athia Karuithia for visa application purposes. Karuitha plans to visit me in South Africa from May 2021.

I work as the Research, Partnership, and Communications Coordinator, African Centre for the Study of the United States of America at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.

My residential address is 303 Princess Place, Parklane, Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa.

Karuithia is a close friend whom I have worked with on several assignments. Given our acquaintance, Mr Karuitha will reside at my residence for the duration of his stay in South Africa.

Besides, Karuitha has previously lived in South Africa between 2017 and 2020. At no time did he ever overstay his visa. I am confident that he will travel back to Kenya within the timelines stipulated in the visa.

Moreover, Karuitha will abide by the health requirements of the South African government, including taking a COVID-19 test.

I have attached my lease as proof of residence and a copy of my work permit in South Africa. Please contact me in case of additional information and clarification.
