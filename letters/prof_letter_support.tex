\begin{letter}{CLM Faculty Office\\University of the
Witwatersrand\\Johannesburg}
\opening{The CLM Faculty Office,}

Like most of my Full-time PhD students, who though were physically
present here in Johannesburg during all of 2020, Mr Wycliffe Oluoch had
his work -- particularly secondary data collection from WBS computer lab
and Wits Libraries -- interrupted for over a period of six months due to
the Covid-19 pandemic caused national lock-down orders. And this delay
is in addition to Mr Olouch's extensive primary data collection
engagement that had taken him to over fifteen African countries prior to
the pandemic; so he was already playing catch-up as our previous
communication with the Post-Graduate Studies Committee would show.

In my place as his supervisor, who is intimately aware of the
significance of this disruption and especially in the midst of the
impressive PhD work he is piecing together, I am strongly in support of
his request for extension of about a quarter of the year to enable him
submit a completed work. It is a high quality work that Wits Business
School and the University at large will be proud of.

Thank you in advance for seeing very cogent reasons to grant Mr Oluoch
this requested extension.

Sincerely yours,

\longindentation=0pt
