Like most of my Full-time PhD students, who though were physically present here in Johannesburg during all of 2020, Mr Wycliffe Oluoch had his work – particularly secondary data collection from WBS computer lab and Wits Libraries – interrupted for over a period of six months due to the Covid-19 pandemic caused national lock-down orders. And this delay is in addition to Mr Olouch’s extensive primary data collection engagement that had taken him to over fifteen African countries prior to the pandemic; so he was already playing catch-up as our previous communication with the Post-Graduate Studies Committee would show.

In my place as his supervisor, who is intimately aware of the significance of this disruption and especially in the midst of the impressive PhD work he is piecing together, I am strongly in support of his request for extension of about a quarter of the year to enable him submit a completed work. It is a high quality work that Wits Business School and the University at large will be proud of.

Thank you in advance for seeing very cogent reasons to grant Mr Oluoch this requested extension.

Sincerely yours,
